Alright, I got to admit that creating a blog and maintaining one is a pretty good side hustle for any game developer out there. Even though I can't promise to post regularly, at least I have some place to share my opinions. Whenever you decide to read my posts, please keep in mind that you can encounter posts that are in progress.

I really do hope that you will enjoy your stay here.
