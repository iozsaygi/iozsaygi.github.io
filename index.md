Alright, I got to admit that creating a blog and maintaining one is a pretty good side hustle for any game developer out there. Itâ€™s been almost five years now since I joined the games industry, and I had the chance to work on several platforms, including PC, mobile, and virtual reality. Even if it is a short period of time, I still feel like I have some stories to share. I hope you will enjoy your stay here as much as I enjoyed writing those posts.
